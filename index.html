    <h2>Spicy Nastha</h2>
    <h3>It started with one man, a truck and a love of south Indian food</h3>
    <p>Londoner Lewis Cummings was a newspaper man, but his real love was curry. When he wasn’t working he was cooking, practicing the skills he had learnt in his local London curry house and on the beaches and backwaters of Kerala.
      It was at the Sea Sessions Festival, in his future wife Grainne’s home county of Donegal, that he saw food traders setting up shop and realised what he needed to do next.
      He bought his own hand-painted truck and drove it straight to his first festival in Temple House, Sligo.
      Next up was the Dublin food scene, where he set up a stall on the Grand Canal, with queues forming in wind and rain for his coconut chicken and potato curries.
      By 2016, with six markets going strong, it was time for the couple - married now, with a son, Flynn - to open their first premises.
      With a background in design, Grainne’s ­­vision for the interior was clear: a series of intimate spaces in earthy shades, dotted with antique finds.
      The result? A down to earth family business, built with grit and good will, that always offers a warm welcome and good food.
      This year saw the opening of their second restaurant in Stoneybatter.</p>
